# 🚀 MySecondMind Development Roadmap

## Current Status: Phase 1 Complete ✅

### ✅ Completed Features
- **Advanced Search Engine** with domain-specific URL matching
- **Complete CRUD Operations** for all content types (tasks, notes, links, reminders)
- **Natural Language Processing** with Groq LLaMA-3 for intent classification
- **Slash Commands** for quick actions (/delete, /complete, /edit)
- **Privacy-First ID System** with sequential numbers (1,2,3,4) instead of exposed UUIDs

---

## 🎯 Current Phase: Enhanced User Experience

### Phase 1: ✅ Sequential Number System (COMPLETED)
**Goal:** Privacy-friendly content management with simple numbers

**Features Implemented:**
- Session mapping: Display numbers (1,2,3,4) → Database UUIDs  
- Privacy protection: UUIDs never exposed to users
- Simple commands: `delete 3`, `complete 2`, `edit 1 new content`
- Session timeout: 30 minutes for security

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Privacy: No UUID exposure
- ✅ UX: Easy to remember/type
- ✅ Security: Session-based mapping

---

## 🔄 Next Phases

### Phase 2: 🎯 Smart NLP Content Matching (NEXT)
**Goal:** Natural language content identification without numbers

**Planned Features:**
- **Content-based matching**: `"delete the call mom task"`
- **Fuzzy title matching**: `"remove meeting task"` → finds "Meeting tomorrow at 3"
- **Partial content matching**: `"complete report"` → finds "finish my report by Friday"
- **Smart disambiguation**: When multiple matches, ask user to choose

**Implementation Plan:**
- [ ] Add fuzzy string matching library (fuzzywuzzy/rapidfuzz)
- [ ] Create content matcher service
- [ ] Enhance NLP patterns for content-based commands
- [ ] Add disambiguation logic for multiple matches

**Example Usage:**
```
User: "delete the call mom task"
Bot: ✅ Deleted task: "call mom"

User: "complete report"  
Bot: ✅ Completed task: "finish my report by Friday"

User: "delete meeting"
Bot: Found 2 matching tasks:
     1. Meeting tomorrow at 3
     2. Prepare meeting agenda
     Which one? (1 or 2)
```

---

### Phase 3: 🧠 Context Awareness & Memory (PLANNED)
**Goal:** Contextual understanding and conversation memory

**Planned Features:**
- **Conversation context**: `"delete that one"` → refers to last mentioned item
- **Reference tracking**: `"the second task"` → refers to #2 from last view
- **Smart defaults**: `"delete"` → asks what to delete with recent context
- **Undo functionality**: `"undo that deletion"`

**Implementation Plan:**
- [ ] Add conversation history tracking
- [ ] Implement reference resolution system
- [ ] Create context-aware command processor
- [ ] Add undo/redo functionality with action history

**Example Usage:**
```
User: "/tasks"
Bot: Shows tasks 1-4...

User: "delete the second one"
Bot: ✅ Deleted task #2: "call mom"

User: "actually, undo that"
Bot: ✅ Restored task: "call mom"
```
